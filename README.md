## katsuyou

Katsuyou is a simple flashcard-like app for practicing conjugation of Japanese
verbs.

It's written in Elm, because it sounded like a fun sideproject. ;)

### Development

```sh
$ npm install
$ elm package install
$ npm start
```

The development server will be running at http://localhost:8080
