## katsuyou

Katsuyou is a simple flashcard-like app for practicing conjugation of Japanese
verbs. [Check it out here](https://spect88.github.io/katsuyou/).


It's written in [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/), because it sounded like a fun
sideproject. ;)

### Development

```sh
$ npm install
$ elm package install
$ npm start
```

The development server will be running at http://localhost:8080
